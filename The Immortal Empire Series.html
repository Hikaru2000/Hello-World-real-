<!-- 1st Book God Save the Queen -->

<h2>God Save the Queen</h2>

<p>The undead matriarch of a Britain where the Aristocracy is made up of 
werewolves and vampires, where goblins live underground and mothers know better 
than to let their children out after dark. A world where being nobility means 
being infected with the Plague (side-effects include undeath), Hysteria is the 
popular affliction of the day, and leeches are considered a delicacy. And a world 
where technology lives side by side with magic. The year is 2012 and Pax 
Britannia still reigns.</p>

<p>Xandra Vardan is a member of the elite Royal Guard, and it is her duty to 
protect the Aristocracy. But when her sister goes missing, Xandra will set out 
on a path that undermines everything she believed in and uncover a conspiracy 
that threatens to topple the empire. And she is the key-the prize in a very 
dangerous struggle.</p>

<img style="float: left;" src="D:\Website\Book Website\The Immortal Empire\The Queen Is Dead.jpg">

<h2>The Queen is Dead</h2>

<p>Nothing lasts forever---and immortality isn't all its cracked up to be.</p>

<p>When her brother Val gets in over his head in an investigation of Half-Blood
 disappearances and goes missing himself, it's up to Xandra, newly crowned Goblin
 Queen, to get him back and bring the atrocities to light. Xandra must frequent 
the seediest parts of London, while also coping with what she is, the political 
factions vying for her favor, and the all too-close scrutiny of Queen Victoria, 
who wants her head. Add this to being a suspect in a murder investigation, a 
werewolf boyfriend with demands of his own, and a mother hell bent on destroying 
the monarchy, and Xandra barely knows which way is up. One thing she does know 
is that she's already lost one sibling, she's not about to lose another. </p>

<!-- 3rd Book Long Live the Queen-->
<img style="float: left;" src="D:\Website\Book Website\The Immortal Empire\Long Live the Queen.jpg">

<h2>Long Live the Queen</h2>

<p>Xandra Vardan thought life would be simpler when she accepted the goblin crown and became their queen, but life has only become more complicated. Everyone -- 
vampires, werewolves and humans -- wants the goblins on their side, because whoever has the goblins -- wins.</p>

<p>Queen Victoria wants her head, Alpha wolf Vex wants her heart, and she still doesn't know the identity of the person who wanted her blood. What she does know is 
that a project from one of the 'secret' aristocrat labs has gotten free and she's the only one who can stop the perfect killing machine -- a sixteen year-old girl. 
With human zealots intent on ridding the world of anyone with plagued blood and supernatural politics taking Britain to the verge of civil war, Xandra's finding out 
that being queen isn't all it's cracked up to be, and if she doesn't do something fast, hers will be the shortest reign in history.</p> 

<p>The fantastic conclusion to the series that started with the spectacular undead steampunk debut, God Save the Queen and The Queen is Dead.</p>
